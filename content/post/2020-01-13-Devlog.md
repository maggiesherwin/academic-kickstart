# Starting to Think About Museums

This week, one of the first questions we had to thing about was concerning the very definition of a museum. Personally, I chose to define a museum as anything. I did this because once we begin to think about what a museum is (a collection of objects and artefacts that have been deemed significant), this also brings in spaces like the home, stores, junkyards, and other places outside of the standard institution. I believe that it is important to do this, as to limit "important" objects to ones that have been chosen by these institutions limits our perception of history to specific narratives. By opening this up, we can begin to understand that history is not only found in objects in museums, but also in everyday objects and places that we encounter. 

This idea of the history in the everyday is related to my interests in museums, which is how museums and collectors choose what to prioritize when it comes to their processes of archiving and curation, and how the ideas of current versus future value factors into that. 

this will become the kernel for your first devlog post
you will also indicate in this first devlog which museum you think you’d like to work with, and why
frame some of your response with deliberate reference to things you’ve encountered in the reading

This week I also began working with Tropy and trying to figure out how to use it for our needs. Looking at the Museum of History site and the metadata that they attached to their records, I wanted to match the fields so that when doing our own records, we are not losing any information, regardless of whether or not it seems relevant to our needs. I felt this necessary because very often information concerning artefacts can be lost, and by not including every piece of information we would be losing out on things that may becone relevant in the future. One of my first frustrations with the program was in its limited vocabularies. Being in Canada, we use the CHIN (Canadian Heritage Information Network) core standards to define artefacts, but this has not been made into a vocabulary on the site that Tropy privides. 

To find an appropriate vocabulary, I began searching this [site](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/ "Title") (which Tropy provided) for vocabularies related to the humanities, but was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number available. So, instead I decided to search for terms, as that was the specific aspect that I wanted to match with the CHIN standards. I chose to search "materials" as it is a very important and relevant field that many vocabularies were missing, making it a good indicator that a vocabulary would be useable. By doing this I came across [Schema](https://schema.org/ "schema"), a vocabulary that - according to their site - is used by over 10 million websites. I downloaded this vocabulary and added it to Tropy, and finally created a template that will let me add the relevant information to my records. Click [this link](https://github.com/maggiesherwin/academic-kickstart/tree/master/assets/files/museum-documents) to see and download the schema vocabulary and Museum of History template that I have used/created.
