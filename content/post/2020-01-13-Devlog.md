# Starting to Think About Museums

This week, one of the first questions we had to thing about was concerning the very definition of a museum. Personally, I chose to define a museum as anything. I did this because once we begin to think about what a museum is (a collection of objects and artefacts that have been deemed significant), this also brings in spaces like the home, stores, junkyards, and other places outside of the standard institution. I believe that it is important to do this, as to limit "important" objects to ones that have been chosen by these institutions limits our perception of history to specific narratives. By opening this up, we can begin to understand that history is not only found in objects in museums, but also in everyday objects and places that we encounter. 

This idea of the history in the everyday is related to my interests in museums, which is how museums and collectors choose what to prioritize when it comes to their processes of archiving and curation, and how the ideas of current versus future value factors into that. 

this will become the kernel for your first devlog post
you will also indicate in this first devlog which museum you think you’d like to work with, and why
frame some of your response with deliberate reference to things you’ve encountered in the reading
