# Digital Archives
For my post, I will be discussing the digital archives that digital versions of traditional media archive collections, as opposed to the archiving of files and specific states of a computer. Because of this, I define digital archives as digital collections of primary sources that are compiled for a specific purpose. Digital archives differ from databases in that they make the actual archived object available for the user to access, as opposed to databases which simply share information about these objects. For example, IMDB is a database containing information about films, while one's itunes library is an archive in that it also makes the actual music available alongside the informtation.
### Main Uses
- Making existing archives available through digital means
- Create accessible libraries of media
- Allows collections to be connected regardless of actual distance

Because of the limited capabilities of the internet (i.e. we cannot download a pizza YET), archives are mostly useful for media that can be in a file format that can be downladed like music, images, ebooks, or movies. This has become more complicated recently with the creating of 3D mapped objects that are able to be printed, allowing things like objects to become archived while also bringing up questions about whether a copy of an object can subtsitute for the object itself.
#### Questions
- What other uses can you think of for making archives digital?
- What are the limitations of digital formats, and how will they affect the future of archives?
### Benefits
In general, digital archives are beneficial in that they preserve files and digital objects that may have any number of things happen to them. Digital archives are useful for us as historians because they make often difficult to find sources searchable and available for use. These archives can be brought further and become more enriched with the addition of meta- and paradata which add context and can be used to create a narrative. This is why while a collection of files is technically an archive, it is in the way that an old man's collection of newspapers since the 80s are: it's interesting and a lot of stuff, but more work has to be done to make it usable.

Digital archives are also good in that they allow the archivists to access files and sources in order to add them to their own collections, enriching networks between archives in a way that traditional means do not allow. Duplicating a public domain file is much easier than duplicating a real object.

### Creating Digital Archives
At the moment, the most accessible application for creating a digital web-based archive collection is pinterest, which archives an image from a specific web page, adding it to a board that has been created by the user. The user then can add more notes to that image. This is useful for people that want to save very static sites that likely will not change, such as recipe sites and blogs. It becomes more complicated when a user does not save an image from the source site, and at some point the path becomes broken. Furthermore, it lacks the capability to make music or video files useable on the webpage. It is also notable that its primary use by users is simply sharing the same pins within the site, meaning that there is rarely a need to find the source page of the image.

As it stands, there are very little options for accessible online archive creation. Most tools are aimed at institutions that are able to host their own servers. I personally tried two before realizing that I am not getting paid to do this, and I don't actually have to create a digital arhcive. The only other tool is the Internet Archive, which has its own issues.

### The Internet Archive
Being a completely public site and with very little regulations concerning what is allowed to be uploaded, archive.org is the internet's lergest collection of web pages and files. It is an archive used by many institutions, some with their own collections on the site of their own uploaded media. The issue with archive.org is that there is very little restriction surrounding who is allowed to upload what, with quite a few files being hosted for download illegally.

### Copyright Laws and Digital Archiving 
One of the main issues surrounding digtal archives is that they are able to make objects available outside of copyright law. Fortunately, this is not something we encounter often as historians, as most sources are already public domain and can be freely shared. It is a relevant issue when it comes to more mordern historical objects and documents. For example, a documentary film might record important historical information, but because it is a film, direct contact with the information is not freely available, but instead behind a paywall. 

With things like images, there is very rarely any issue with the downloading and copying of files without the creator's consent, and if there is, it is because the images were being used for a profit. This laisez-faire attitude is not applicable to how the sharing of music and video files are handled. Pirating media online is illegal in most countries, with many file sharing sites facing judicial consequences for enabling the sharing of files. This will become even more complicated as early film begins to enter the public domain, including Mickey Mouse in 2024.
