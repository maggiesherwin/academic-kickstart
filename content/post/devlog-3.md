# VMaking up for Missed Work

I have missed three devlogs. I have missed three devlogs and I need to find out how to make it up. So, to try that I will be examining why I did not complete these devlogs so that I can improve. 

Talking about the work you are doing can be tricky, and this is especially true when it feels as though you are not actually doing anything. I think that this is my issue so far, that it has been very theory heavy, with us talking about big ideas and possibilites. While I think that this is absolutely necessary for the class and for learning, I find that for my personal way of learning, I need to be doing. And I need to be able to criticize myself in order to improve. 

With devlogs, I often (wrongly) feel as though reflecting is not being proactive, and so I push them aside until they are forgotten. And then this happens. What I need to do is recognize that it is helpful to look back and reflect on what I am learning in university. Without that, I risk passively taking in information without really understanding what it means. 

So, I will try to do better at both keeping on top of my work/devlogs, and with actually appreciating and reflecting on what I am learning. Hopefully that will help.
